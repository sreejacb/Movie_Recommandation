# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using Streamlit

The objective of this project was to build a content-based movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset available on Kaggle. The system's primary objective was to provide users with personalized movie suggestions based on the textual attributes of films, including genres, keywords, and cast. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Streamlit, the project sought to empower users to explore and discover similar movies based on their preferences.
